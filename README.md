# New Relic's integration with Flutter

This project uses New Relic's iOS and Android agents to provide observability into a Flutter application. Currently New Relic supports agents for single OS applications such as iOS/Android. As Flutter/other cross platform frameworks grow in popularity, it's necessary for New Relic's observability options to expand as well. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application integrated with New Relic One.
